# Anderson Advenures

My first solo project with Vue was an game to help my son with his times tables. You battle through different levels of monsters (and difficulty) and there is also the option to "collect" defeated monsters. 

## Demo

https://onemanwenttomow.github.io/anderson-adventures/

  
## Run Locally

Clone the project. To use the sockets part of the project you will also need to clone this repo -> https://github.com/onemanwenttomow/battlemasters-sockets-server 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/onemanwenttomow/anderson-adventures
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd anderson-adventures
```

Use something like http-server to serve the site locally (or just open the index.html file in the browser).
